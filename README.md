# PKGBUILD files for ITK pkgs

## How to build

You could just download the `PKGBUILD` file you need, and build it with:

```bash
archlinuxcn-x86_64-build
```

Note, you need to add [ArchLinux CN repo](https://github.com/archlinuxcn/repo), or you'll also need to build the depends which are not available in official repo.
